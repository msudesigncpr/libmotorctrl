# libmotorctrl

This is a library for controlling the CMMO-ST motors on the colony-picking
robot design project. It provides a `DriveManager` class which maintains Modbus
connections with each of the drives and provides convenience methods for
controlling them. See the [documentation][apidocs] for more information.
